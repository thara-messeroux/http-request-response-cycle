# HTTP Request–Response Cycle (GA)

## Start Every Coding Lab Ritual
- Create a fresh folder for the lab
- Initialize git
- Create README early
- Commit small wins often (one concept group per commit)
- Push to GitHub so progress is safe

## Key Vocabulary
- **Client**: the browser (Chrome/Safari)
- **Server**: the computer that receives requests and sends responses
- **HTTP**: rules for how clients and servers communicate
- **Request**: message sent from client to server
- **Response**: message sent back from server to client

## Concepts: What is HTTP?

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a set of rules that defines how a browser
(client) communicates with a server.

- The browser sends a request
- The server sends back a response
- Each request–response pair is independent

### Stateless
HTTP is stateless, which means the server does not remember previous requests.

- After the server sends a response, the interaction ends
- Each new request is treated as if it is the first time
- Any “memory” (logins, carts, preferences) must be added separately (e.g., cookies or sessions)
