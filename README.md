# HTTP Request–Response Cycle (GA)

## Start Every Coding Lab Ritual
- Create a fresh folder for the lab
- Initialize git
- Create README early
- Commit small wins often (one concept group per commit)
- Push to GitHub so progress is safe

## Key Vocabulary
- **Client**: the browser (Chrome/Safari)
- **Server**: the computer that receives requests and sends responses
- **HTTP**: rules for how clients and servers communicate
- **Request**: message sent from client to server
- **Response**: message sent back from server to client

## Concepts: What is HTTP?

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a set of rules that defines how a browser
(client) communicates with a server.

- The browser sends a request
- The server sends back a response
- Each request–response pair is independent

### Stateless
HTTP is stateless, which means the server does not remember previous requests.

- After the server sends a response, the interaction ends
- Each new request is treated as if it is the first time
- Any “memory” (logins, carts, preferences) must be added separately (e.g., cookies or sessions)

## Fundamentals: Request–Response Cycle

The HTTP request–response cycle describes how communication on the web works.

1. A user performs an action (typing a URL, clicking a link, submitting a form)
2. The browser (client) sends an HTTP request to a server
3. The server receives the request and processes it
4. The server sends an HTTP response back to the browser
5. The browser displays the result to the user

Each request–response interaction is separate.
After the response is sent, the connection ends.
